# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **machine learning model for predicting heart disease** using patient health data.  
It was developed as part of a **college AI assignment** and demonstrates the use of multiple classification algorithms to identify whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.  

## ⚙️ Features  
- Preprocessing and cleaning of medical dataset  
- Implementation of **classification algorithms**:  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Decision Tree  
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix  
- Visualizations for better understanding of model behavior  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **scikit-learn**  
- **pandas**  
- **numpy**  
- **matplotlib / seaborn**  

## 📊 Dataset  
The project uses a **heart disease dataset** (commonly from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease) or Kaggle).  
It contains patient attributes such as:  
- Age  
- Sex  
- Blood pressure  
- Cholesterol level  
- Maximum heart rate  
- And other medical indicators  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
